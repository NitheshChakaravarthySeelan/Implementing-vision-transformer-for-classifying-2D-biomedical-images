# MedMNIST ViT Fine-Tuning for 2D Biomedical Image Classification

This repository implements a fine-tuning approach for a Vision Transformer (ViT) model on MedMNISTv2 datasets for 2D biomedical image classification. Our work is inspired by the paper:

**"Implementing vision transformer for classifying 2D biomedical images"**  
Scientific Reports, 2024  
DOI: [10.1038/s41598-024-63094-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-63094-9)

The paper explores how a pre-trained ViT (vit-base-patch16-224) can be fine-tuned on various biomedical image classification tasks, achieving competitive results against CNN-based models.

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model for biomedical image classification using the MedMNISTv2 dataset. We target four subsets:
- **BloodMNIST**
- **BreastMNIST**
- **PathMNIST**
- **RetinaMNIST**

By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of ViT, our approach captures global dependencies in images and achieves higher classification accuracy on these datasets. Our experiments show that the fine-tuned ViT model achieves:
- **BloodMNIST:** 97.90%
- **BreastMNIST:** 90.38%
- **PathMNIST:** 94.62%
- **RetinaMNIST:** 57.0%

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MedMNIST-ViT-Project.git
   cd MedMNIST-ViT-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

### Data Preparation

Download the MedMNISTv2 datasets as described in `data/download_instructions.md`. You can also load a dataset directly via Hugging Face Datasets:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("albertvillanova/medmnist-v2", "bloodmnist")
```

### Training

To train the model on, for example, the BloodMNIST subset, run:
```bash
python src/train.py
```
This script:
- Loads the pre-trained ViT model and adapts its classifier head.
- Applies preprocessing with the ViT image processor.
- Trains the model using Hugging Face's Trainer API with defined training hyperparameters.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, run:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```
This script computes metrics (accuracy, F1 score, etc.) and saves visualizations (confusion matrices, ROC curves) in the `results/plots/` folder.

## Results and Visualizations

The following key outputs are generated:
- **Training & Validation Loss Curves:**  
  Displayed over epochs to show model convergence.
- **Accuracy & F1 Score Metrics:**  
  Evaluated on the test set.
- **Confusion Matrices and ROC Curves:**  
  Visualizations that help analyze classification performance.
- **Grad-CAM Visualizations (Optional):**  
  Heatmaps highlighting important regions in input images.

Check the `results/plots/` folder and `metrics.csv` for detailed performance analysis.
